# Circadian-Rhythm-Robustness

This is the complete statistics of Entrainment time. 
The first column is the initial phase of reference states.
The second column is the amount of jet lags in hours. The
third column is the parameter perturbed. The fourth column
represents whether the control is open-loop or feedback. The
fifth column is the entrainment time of the nominal model.
The sixth column represents the lower quartile, median and
upper quartiles of entrainment times in hours. The seventh
represents the percentage change of medium compared to
the nominal entrainment time. The last column shows the
normalized variance of the entrainment time distribution.
Bold number is the better one between open-loop and feedback.
